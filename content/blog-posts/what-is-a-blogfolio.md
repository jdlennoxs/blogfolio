I like the idea of a platform where I can share my ideas and projects. This site is for just that.

I'm a software engineer who works across technical and product solutions. I've been working within development teams since 2014; building web applications, practicing agile methodologies, and designing end to end architectures and solutions. While developing a career focused in the mechanics of programming I've also gained a lot of interest in the effects of the digital age on our world and what is the role of our industry. What will be the impact of big data, smart cities, and blockchains on our lives, our jobs or our relationships?

It's easy to get trapped inside the development bubble where the focus is on staying up to date, knowing the latest languages and frameworks, striving for source code nirvana. I believe that considering the bigger picture, the ethics, economics, and politics of tech, should be an important practice for developers. It helps to ground career expectations, understand the motivations of the industry you work in and provides a strong platform for evaluating your own happiness, goals and progress. I think awareness of these topics is definitely a useful tool to new and upcoming leaders.
Enjoying and practicing your trade also helps you to grow, this site will function as both my blog and portfolio to showcase projects, hacks and opinions. A blogfolio?
I consider myself as something of a budding technologist with a range of interests.

The broader our interests and knowledge the more [T shaped](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) we can be and the more places we can apply our skills.

This is my testing ground and my sounding board. Stay tuned!
