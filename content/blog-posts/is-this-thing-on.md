# Hi
## What am I reading right now?
I've been harbouring on the idea of creating myself a website for a while now. I like the idea of a platform where I can share ideas, projects and opinions as well as test new skills. The fruits of my efforts are this, currently rather bare, personal site.

## Who am I?
I am Jack. As mentioned in the bio, I'm a software engineer who works across technical and product solutions. I've been working within development teams since 2014; building web applications, practicing agile methodologies, and designing end to end architectures and solutions. While developing a career focused in the mechanics of programming I've also gained a lot of interest in the effects of the digital age on our world and what is the role of our industry. What will be the impact of big data, smart cities, and blockchains on our lives, our jobs or our relationships?

## Why does this thing exist?
It's easy to get trapped inside the development bubble where the onus is on staying up to date, knowing the latest languages and frameworks, striving for source code nirvana. I believe that considering the bigger picture, the ethics, economics, and politics of tech, should be an important practice for developers. It helps to ground career expectations, understand the motivations of the industry you work in and provides a strong platform for evaluating your own happiness, goals and progress. I think awareness of these topics is definitely a useful tool to new and upcoming leaders. The broader our interests and knowledge the more [T shaped](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) we can be and the more places we can apply our skills.

I'd like to frame myself as something of a budding technologist, and so the purpose of this site is a sounging board for myself, to refine my opinions and showcase my interests. A blogfolio?

I'd like to organically grow the features and content on the site with what I would like to produce, we'll see how it goes!
